# Bar-Graph-Maker (Note: this program was made without the ease from a charting package and is instead graphed via ASCII symbols)

This bar graph maker allows for you to create a bar graph with two bars per specified year (specified via the data.xlsx file). By using the data.xlsx file you are also able to change the comparison that the two bars in the bar graph are used for (e.g. sellers and their profits, men's average vs women's average, player 1's score vs. player 2's score, etc.).

In order to use the barGraphMaker.py file, please specify the years in the first column and then the names and values for the second and third columns (representing the bars) via the data.xlsx file. Lastly, please open a command line window, change the directory to the location where both your barGraphMaker.py and data.xlsx files are contained and type in "barGraphMaker.py data.xlsx" to view your bar graph.
