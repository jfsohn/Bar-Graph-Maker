# Bar-Graph-Maker
# Note: this program was  made without the use of a charting package and is graphed via ASCII symbols

This bar graph maker allows for you to create a bar graph with two bars per specified year (specified via the data.xlsx file). By using the data.xlsx file you are also able to change the comparison that the two bars in the bar graph are used for (e.g. sellers and their profits, men's average vs women's average, player 1's score vs. player 2's score, etc.).
