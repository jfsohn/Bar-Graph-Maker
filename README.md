# Bar-Graph-Maker
# Note: this program was  made without the use of a charting package and is graphed via ASCII symbols

This bar graph maker allows for you to create a bar graph with two bars per specified year (specified via the data.xlsx file). By using the data.xlsx file you are also able to change the comparison that the two bars in the bar graph are used for (e.g. sellers and their profits, men's average vs women's average, player 1's score vs. player 2's score, etc.).

In order to use the barGraphMaker.py file, please specify the years that you would like to use, as well as the two bars that you would like to use for your bar graph. Next, please specify the values that you would like to use for each of these throw columns. You may change the column names of the for the second and third columns, as these are the two bars that are being compared. Lastly, please open a command line window, change the directory to the location where both your barGraphMaker.py and data.xlsx files are contained and type in "barGraphMaker.py data.xlsx" to view your bar graph.
